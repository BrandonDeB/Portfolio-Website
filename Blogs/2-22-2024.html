        <h2>Using Selenium in Python to Pull student data</h2>
        <p>
            I built a basic webscraper using Selenium in Python to help gather the student data I can later use to build schedules for students. It does not pull all the information needed yet, but I laid out a proof of concept by pulling the student's name, 
            college, and catalog year. Eventually for advisors to use this it should be pulling the information from an advisor accessible source, but I am simply doing this in order to start gathering information about building the schedules. Also,
            learning the webscraping part should help me later when needing to pull data about specific classes offered at LSU.

        <ul>
            <li>Pull the rest of the Degree Audit Information</li>
            <li>Make a Student class to hold all the information</li>
